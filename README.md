# Relation-Extraction-from-Natural-Language-using-PyTorch

Developing deep learning models to predict knowledge graph relations based on user utterances in a conversational system. The project uses a dataset of utterances paired with corresponding relations from the Freebase schema to train models capable of extracting the invoked relations from new utterances.

1. train.py: Train your PyTorch model.
2. inference.py: Use the trained model to generate predictions.
3. preprocess.py: Preprocess the text data (tokenization, feature extraction).
4. model.py: Define the model architecture.
5. submission.py: Create the Kaggle submission CSV file.
6. hw1_report.pdf: Your report explaining your approach.
7. requirements.txt: List of dependencies.
