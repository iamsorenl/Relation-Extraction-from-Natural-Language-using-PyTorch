# Relation-Extraction-from-Natural-Language-using-PyTorch
Developing deep learning models to predict knowledge graph relations based on user utterances in a conversational system. The project uses a dataset of utterances paired with corresponding relations from the Freebase schema to train models capable of extracting the invoked relations from new utterances.
